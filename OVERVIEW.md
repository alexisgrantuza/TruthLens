Yes, AI models and specialized tools can be used to determine if a photo or a video is faked or AI-generated, often with high accuracy. However, no detection method is 100% foolprof, and it is an ongoing "arms race" as generative AI technologies improves rapidly.  


How AI Detectors Tools Work:


AI Deepfake and image detection tools use advanced machine learning, computer vision, and forensic analysis to spot inconsicies that are often imperceptible to the human eye.
